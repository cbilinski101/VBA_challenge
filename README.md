This repository contains 2 files (1-file is Excel and 1-file is VBA Module) for the Module 2 Challenge, and
4 screenshots of the results (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4).

I mostly used the previous Module 2 "02-VBA-Scripting/file 3 " activities - 04-Stu_Checkerboard-CodingLogic,
06-Stu_CreditCardChecker-CellComparison, 07-Stu_Census_Pt1 & Pt2.

I used the before and after school hours to ask questions about the assignment, the instructors and fellow students
helped me to understand the context of the assignment. I was overthnking the information and it turned out to be
less complicated then I originally thought. 

I received assistance through the "Tutoring Sessions" with Brandon Wong. He helped me to understand
the loop process for calulating and obtaining the "Quarterly Change" values.

I tried ChatGPT for some insight but found the answers were too complicated and not very helpful.
